## TO DO

* <s>Create folders</s>
* <s>Add some sample files</s>
* Create `package.json` for dependencies (*libraries and gulp*)
* Create `gulpfile.js`
* Modify `.gitignore`
* Write tasks for gulp
* Explore current `index.js` to find out if it is needed
* Templates:
  * Separate files and then pack all of them together
  * Put everything to `index.html` inside script tag


## Content

`Source` folder contains:

* models
* collections
* views
* router

## Install

### **Not done**

To make app work you need to install dependencies first.

**If you don't want to install node, contact me**

1. Install `npm` (node packet manager, comes with **node**)
2. After go to this folder in the terminal
3. Run `npm install` it will install required libraries to node_modules folder


## Deploy

### **Not done**

Application uses browserify, therefore you need to rebuild app every time you made a change.

1. Simply run `gulp` in the terminal (it will automatically build the app and will keep looking for file changes)
